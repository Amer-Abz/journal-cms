# CMS Development Log

This log tracks the progress, decisions, and important notes during the development of the CMS.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Project Initialization & Next.js Setup

*   **Task:** Set up initial project files and initialize Next.js.
*   **Details:**
    *   Created `ROADMAP.md` to outline the overall project structure and phases. (Recreated after Next.js init)
    *   Created this `LOG.md` file to document progress. (Recreated after Next.js init)
    *   Successfully initialized a new Next.js project in the current directory using `create-next-app` with the following options: TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, `src/` directory, App Router, and `@/*` import alias.
    *   Encountered and resolved several conflicts with existing files and directories during the `create-next-app` process by implementing a cleanup and temporary directory strategy.
    *   User requested multi-language support (Arabic and English, default English). Plan will be updated to reflect this.
*   **Next Steps:** Update the plan to include i18n setup. Then, proceed with installing Prisma and PostgreSQL dependencies.
